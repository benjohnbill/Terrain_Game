/**
 * The Game Runtime — a thin state-owning shell.
 *
 * Authority: Wayfinder gate 02 § 6. The surface is exactly three members:
 *
 *     currentActor  -> ActorId
 *     view(viewerId) -> MatchView     // viewer-safe; blurred here, once
 *     submit(intent) -> GameEvent[]   // validate -> resolve -> advance
 *
 * and nothing more. There is deliberately **no snapshot API** (it would hand
 * truth to a caller and void the blur seam) and **no subscription API**
 * (callers pump; `submit` returns the events).
 *
 * Gate 02 also fixes that internal decomposition is an internal seam: this may
 * implement transitions as pure functions behind the shell, and that stays an
 * implementation choice rather than a caller contract.
