# Terrain Game Domain Map

Markers:

- ✅ Verified or accepted in the current project direction.
- ❓ Assumption or proposed concept requiring validation.
- ⛔ Forbidden or rejected direction.

## Core Terms

- ✅ `Map unit`: A playable geographic unit. Currently rendered as a hex, but
  should be designed so it can later become an irregular province.
- ✅ `Terrain-first`: Geography determines combat, economy, population, and
  movement before political control is applied.
- ✅ `Faction`: A political actor controlling map units.
- ✅ `Region value`: The combined economic, population, military, and strategic
  value of a map unit.
- ✅ `Named province`: A medium-sized region composed of one or more map units
  with identity, population weight, economic profile, strategic role,
  background, and event hooks.
- ✅ `Province archetype region`: A broad geography/history frame used to group
  named provinces, such as Central Plains, Guanzhong Passes, Jiangnan Grain
  Belt, Steppe Frontier, or Northern India Route.
- ✅ `Settlement/function layer`: Human use of a place, such as administrative
  center, commercial city, agricultural center, military base, fortress pass,
  port city, mining/workshop district, scholarly/religious center, or frontier
  settlement.
- ✅ `Local garrison`: Military strength assigned to a specific map unit, not a
  global faction-wide force usable everywhere at once.
- ✅ `Standing forces`: Maintained troops directly commanded for attack,
  movement, and critical defense.
- ✅ `Offensive mobilization`: Temporary risky force drawn from population or
  local capacity to support attacks.
- ✅ `Local defense`: Defensive support from garrisons and mobilizable local
  population during invasion.
- ✅ `Latent mobilizable population`: Economic population that may become levy,
  militia, resistance, or rebellion force under pressure.
- ✅ `High complexity, low micromanagement`: Core design principle where deep
  simulation exists under the hood, but the player mainly issues strategic
  intent-level commands.
- ✅ `Strategic posture`: A guidance preset for interpreting the turn and
  allocating action capacities. It is not a direct hidden-bonus mode.
- ✅ `Action capacity`: Turn-available national capability such as command,
  administration, diplomacy, or scholarship/technology.
- ✅ `Strait`: A narrow sea crossing that can allow limited naval movement,
  blockade, or amphibious attack.
- ✅ `Active region`: A region currently simulated and presented in detail.
- ✅ `Background region`: A known world-data region that may be abstracted,
  deferred, or summarized until it becomes relevant.
- ✅ `Relevance-filtered log`: Event log presentation based on player
  influence, strategic importance, and recency rather than raw event volume.

## Terrain Concepts

- ✅ `Plain`: High population and tax potential, lower natural defense.
- ✅ `Grain basin`: High food, population growth, and long-term economic value.
- ✅ `Mountain/pass`: High defense, slow movement, supply friction.
- ✅ `River`: Economic and agricultural bonus, crossing penalty in combat.
- ✅ `Coast/harbor`: Trade and naval access; future naval systems can attach
  here.
- ✅ `Steppe/highland`: Lower settled economy, higher mobility and cavalry-style
  strategic pressure.
- ✅ `Frontier basin`: Region with special resource, pass, loyalty, or trade
  value.
- ✅ Province archetype regions are composed from terrain layers; they are not
  terrain types themselves.
- ✅ Province identity uses three lenses: archetype region, terrain layer, and
  settlement/function layer.
- ✅ Phase 1 stat scope is combat + economy basics: population/economy, local
  garrison, defense, movement/crossing constraints, and strategic tags.
- ✅ Governance-heavy values such as loyalty, unrest, inflation, and deep event
  chains are expansion hooks, not first Phase 1 requirements.
- ✅ Attacks should be standing-force centered with offensive mobilization as
  risky support. Defense should combine garrison and local defense.
- ✅ Complexity is acceptable when it creates meaningful choices or readable
  consequences; it should not become repetitive low-level clicking.
- ✅ Strategic posture presets may be intentionally extreme to show risky
  concentrated strategies, but the player should be able to fine-tune choices.

## World Direction

- ✅ The world is fictional and East Asia-inspired.
- ✅ Real Chinese and East Asian geography should strongly inform terrain
  placement.
- ✅ The world should leave expansion slots for straits, islands, maritime
  powers, northern steppe pressure, and a northern India route.
- ✅ Large world data such as 50x50 is acceptable if the playable and simulated
  scope opens progressively.
- ✅ The first active Phase 1 campaign area should be around 25x25 to 30x30,
  centered on central plains, southern grain regions, and northern frontier
  terrain.
- ✅ The first active Phase 1 area should include roughly 25 to 40 named
  provinces layered over terrain/map units.
- ✅ Place naming uses a hybrid policy: large geography may be historically
  legible, while specific provinces generally use fictional East Asian-style
  names.
- ✅ Player-facing province names should be natural place/geography names, not
  meta design labels using terms equivalent to "-inspired" or "-like."
- ⛔ Do not model a literal historical map so strictly that gameplay balance and
  readability become secondary.

## Open Questions

- ❓ Initial playable map size.
- ❓ Exact terrain taxonomy for Phase 1.
- ❓ Whether local garrison is recruited from population, paid from treasury, or
  both.
- ❓ Whether strait movement requires a harbor, technology, or a separate naval
  capacity.
- ❓ Exact trigger for activating background regions.
- ❓ Exact list of initial named provinces.
- ❓ Exact Phase 1 subset of archetype regions to activate.
- ❓ Exact primary and secondary function assignments for the initial named
  provinces.
