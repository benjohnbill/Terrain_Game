# Sync-Debt Ledger

Tracked ledger required by `.claude/rules/documentation-law.md`
(conflict rule + session-close ritual duty 6). One line per unpaid
documentation debt; strike it (move to Paid) when paid. An unrecorded
debt is a law violation; an unpaid-but-recorded one is normal
operation.

Seeded 2026-07-05 from the Codex governance audit (verdict: ADOPT WITH
FIXES; session `019f3183…`, log in `.context/codex-session-id`).

## Open

- [ ] **Term lifecycle beyond promotion** (Codex P1): define
  proposed → agreed → promoted → renamed → deprecated states in the
  Vocabulary Law; renames are the dangerous case for agents. Add an
  alias field (Korean casual phrases, code identifiers) to glossary
  schema (Codex P2).
- [ ] **Model-doc naming unification + promotion ladders to root**
  (registered 2026-07-05, A-4 B1 discussion): the bespoke per-feature
  model-doc names (MAGNITUDE / FORMULA / MATCHUP / CATALOG /
  STRATEGY-SPACE) are one function ("model/dials doc") under five
  names — a latent proliferation cost. Decide a disciplined convention,
  then give the model layer an explicit birthplace→root promotion
  ladder (model docs → DESIGN) symmetric with GLOSSARY→DOMAIN_MAP and
  RULINGS→ADR, so all three Production tiers connect to root the same
  way. NOT A-4 B1 scope; a deliberate separate pass (user-flagged).

## Deferred (user-decided 2026-07-06, A-4 B6 — revisit on trigger)

- [ ] **`npm run docs:check` lint** (Codex P2, optional tooling):
  grep-level checks — "amended" references without ADR stamp, quickref
  older than newest seal date, duplicate term headers. **User deferred:
  no generator yet; adopt when a misfile actually slips (YAGNI).**
- [ ] **Working-layer sublabels** (Codex P2): distinguish staging
  verdicts / generated digests / planning scratch / risk register
  inside the Working layer. **User deferred: no misfiling observed —
  revisit if it occurs (emergence-limit).**

## Paid

- [x] 2026-07-07 — **SPEC 중원-crown amendment (TC-②) APPLIED,
  user-approved** — SPEC §Match structure re-cut: survivability +
  starting-population parity balanced, geometry/economy asymmetry;
  crown economic only (traffic centrality + long-war stamina, never a
  population edge); center-protagonist stated as measured hypothesis
  with the stable-digestion premium framing. Proposed and approved in
  the 2026-07-07 doc-sync session (propose-never-drift honored).
- [x] 2026-07-07 — **Terrain-cradle → Projection sync (C-loop close
  doc-sync batch)** — DOMAIN_MAP gained a `Terrain Cradle (Authored
  Map)` section (summary + pointer, sync-stamped) promoting void
  terrain / parity start / battle-summoning placement; the Match
  structure parity row re-cut from "mass asymmetry, richer center" to
  parity-v5 wording (TC-①/②) with a supersession note; DESIGN
  §Map Representation Strategy gained the authored-map pipeline
  subsection (map-gen.js determinism, C-loop rhythm, carve principle);
  QUICKREF regenerated (Realm row + 3 promoted-term rows + header
  date). Definitions stay authoritative in
  `docs/features/terrain-cradle/` (single-definition rule). SPEC
  remainder split into its own Open row above.
- [x] 2026-07-06 — **L-level seal-stamp convention ADOPTED (Codex P2,
  A-4 B6)** — the optional validation-level stamp (L0 hand / L1 grid /
  L2 tournament / L3 playtest) codified into
  `.claude/rules/documentation-law.md` § seal mechanics: seals MAY carry
  an L-stamp; applied going forward, retrofit optional, not a fourth
  mandatory field. The other two Codex P2s (`docs:check` lint,
  Working-layer sublabels) were user-deferred — see Deferred above.
- [x] 2026-07-06 — **Economy-legibility surface relocated (A-4 B6)** —
  moved from a doc-sync debt to `docs/DISPLAY-DEBT.md` (the display-debt
  register), where the whole UI-read family now parks. Design deferred
  to B's UI work.

- [x] 2026-07-06 — **ADR header normalization sweep (Codex P1, A-4 B5)**
  — amendment-carrying ADR headers normalized to the law's structured
  fields: 0014 (`Amended by: ADR 0022 (2026-07-01)` + delta), 0015
  (self-amendment stamp for the 2026-07-03 magnitude pass), 0018
  (`Amended by: ADR 0020` + delta), 0020 (`Amends: ADR 0018` + delta).
  Status index table added to `docs/adr/README.md` (26 rows) with a
  pointer to the documentation-law supersession protocol; plain-Accepted
  ADRs carry no relationship field (index is their normalization
  surface — anti-noise reading). *ADR 0019 v5 front-sector amendment is
  a SEPARATE decision (a4-plan B5), user-gated — not part of this line.*
- [x] 2026-07-06 — **Sheet-12 spec gaps → canon (A-4 B4)** — the 7 open
  `mockup/combat-calc/tournament.js` §SPEC_GAPS given a canon home:
  disposition record in `docs/features/match-arc/RULINGS.md` §SPEC_GAPS
  disposition routes each to owning feature + B-design phase + harness
  candidate + recommended lean. All seven defer to B (AI-behavior /
  force-allocation / map-topology — playtest- and B-map-shaped; no paper
  rules authored, per the handoff over-authoring warning). GLOSSARY
  queue-8 and combat-formula INDEX Honest Gaps point to it. Indemnity
  spend (the 8th) was already paid by M14 treasury. Gap ③ (attacking a
  vassal) carries an identity choice surfaced to the user; the rest are
  structural/disposition closes.
- [x] 2026-07-05 — **DOMAIN_MAP slimming (Codex P1)** — Match Arc
  section entries (패권 결정점, 투사 가능 질량, 수락 산술, 복속) cut from
  duplicated mini-spec (sealed numbers, riders, dates) to qualitative
  definition + pointer to the feature GLOSSARY/RULINGS, matching the
  Combat Resolution section's existing discipline. Added the 5 missing
  promoted terms (긴급 투입/예비대, 동원 가시성, 항복 수확, 양동 후속타,
  기축통화 원칙). Sync metadata added at SECTION granularity (not
  per-entry — always-load/maintenance economy; flagged for review).
  A-4 batch B2. *Note: exposed a law-wording tension (single-definition
  rule "Tier 0 after promotion" vs DOMAIN_MAP-as-Projection-summary) —
  see A-4 plan law-gap log.*
- [x] 2026-07-05 — **glossary row splitting (Codex P1)** — match-arc
  GLOSSARY rows cut to definition + current value + seal stamp;
  ruling history (⑧–⑰) relocated to `docs/features/match-arc/
  RULINGS.md`. combat-formula GLOSSARY gained a Status column
  (AGREED / 가안 / candidate). A-4 batch B1.
- [x] 2026-07-05 — **seal registry DECIDED (user): no `docs/SEALS.md`**
  — this ledger + dated in-doc seal stamps remain the mechanism.
- [x] 2026-07-05 — law dial-ownership claim corrected (match-arc values
  acknowledged in GLOSSARY seal rows, not MAGNITUDE).
- [x] 2026-07-05 — mechanical seal definition added to the law
  (status word + date + verdict source).
- [x] 2026-07-05 — QUICKREF trust level made honest (agent-curated
  digest, no generator; dated header).
- [x] 2026-07-05 — this ledger created (Codex fix 2).
